# Cyba Blockchain Security
 
**Cyba Blockchain Security** is a security firm founded by [Alin Barbatei (ABA)](https://github.com/abarbatei/audits), focused on rigorous smart contract and protocol security across EVM and Bitcoin L2 ecosystems, including Stacks (Clarity).

Built on a foundation of deep Web2 and Web3 security experience, Cyba emphasizes high-quality, adversarial reviews and clear, step-by-step guidance throughout every engagement, helping teams not only identify risks, but understand and resolve them with confidence. We are **vehemently opposed** to vague "fix the issue" recommendations.

This repository houses public security audit reports conducted by our team. An overview of the reports can also be viewed, in a more comfortable setting, on our official site at [cybasecurity.io/audits](https://cybasecurity.io/audits).
